# SafeMonit Display Panels

The display panels are your primary interface for managing your devices and viewing the status of your home or business. It is designed to be displayed on a tablet, mobile phone, or any touch-screen device.

## Setup/Installation

SafeMonit panels can be displayed on an Android or iOS tablet device. You can display the panel in within the native browser, or save the application to the device home screen for quicker access. It is recommended for both tablets and mobile devices that support Chrome or Safari to save the panel to the home screen, which will launch the panel as if it were a native app.

## Keeping the Tablet Always On (Android)

For Android devices, you can alter the device settings to prevent the tablet from going to sleep. 

Depending on you tablet, you may have the option to set the screen timeout to "never" under __Settings > Display > Sleep__.

If you do not have this option, you can enable __Settings > Developer options > Stay awake__. This will keep your tablet awake while it is charging. This could be useful if your tablet does not support the "never" screen timeout.

Note: If you don't see Developer options in Settings, it may be made available by going to to __Settings > About > Build number__. Developer options should appear after tapping the build number several times.
