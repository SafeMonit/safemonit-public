SafeMonit provides a simple interface into viewing and managing your home and business automation. Once you've registered your location, here are some of the most common next steps.

## Install SmartApp

If you have a SmartThings hub, the first thing you will want to do is install the SmartApp. This will allow SafeMonit to talk directly to your hub. It's easy, just follow [this guide](https://safemonit.com/guide/install-safemonit-smartthings-smartapp).

## Setup a Display Panel

Now you are ready to create a __Display Panel__. These Panels provide the status of your location and allow you to interact with your smart devices. They are meant to be viewed from your mobile device, or on a tablet mounted somewhere in your home or business.

For more information on how to create and setup panels view [this guide](https://safemonit.com/guide/display-panels).

## Save a Panel To Your Phone

Once you have a panel configured how you like, you need to be able to access it on the go. The easiest way to do this is to access the panel from your mobile phone browser, and choose "Add To Home Screen" from the context menu at the top right. This will give you instructions on how to save the panel to your phone as a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/). This process works on both iOS and Android devices. _Note that clicking "Add To Home Screen" isn't enough; you need to follow the instructions for the app to be saved._

## Setup a Panel in Your Home

The display panel is also most useful when mounted somewhere in your home or business on a tablet device. Currently we recommend any Android tablet, but we highly recommend a Lenovo Tab or Amazon Fire Tablet.

You will want to save the app to the home screen for quicker launch access, and also configure the tablet to never sleep. More details are given on the [panels guide](https://safemonit.com/guide/display-panels). 

## Add a Door Chime

Now it's time to configure some automation settings. The most common security automation setting is a simple door chime. This is accessible from the __Automation__ section of your Location page. You can choose which sensors will trigger the sensor, and even add *Verbal Announcement* when the chime is played.

## Setup Intrusion Monitoring

In your home or business, safety is one of your highest concerns. The __Intrusion Monitoring__ settings allow you to notify all Location members of an intrusion, and also notifies our professional agents of an emergency. You can configure which sensors are monitored for each mode, connect any physical sirens you have available, and even configure your system to be automatically armed and disarmed based on presence sensors.

For more details about setup, view [this guide](https://safemonit.com/guide/intrusion-monitoring).

## Add Cameras

If you have a local IP camera installed in your home, you can potentially integrate it with SafeMonit. We currently support Foscam-brand IP cameras, but our team is working to integrate other models. Once your camera is added to your location you can display a __Live Feed__ of the camera on your Display Panels.
